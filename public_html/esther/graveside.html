<p><b><font size=+1>All of you here knew my parents well.&nbsp; My father
was the outgoing one, and my mother was more retiring. However, those of
you who knew her well know that she was the power behind the throne.&nbsp;
Although she did not join a lot of organizations and was not a “macher”
outside the home, inside the home she was the business manager, director
of finance, secretary and receptionist extraordinaire, and the brains that
solved the practical issues in life.&nbsp; My father would have been lost
without her, and much as she worshipped him, he equally loved and appreciated
her.&nbsp; They went everywhere together—although she was the one who told
him which route to travel, not only on the road but in life.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>They moved to Martin’s Run at her suggestion, and it
was a good move for them. My mother was happy there. She made wonderful
friends, for the first time in her life got involved in activities from
the evening discussion group to the literature group to publishing her
poetry in Martin’s Runs’ resident newspaper.&nbsp; She developed her own
interests and really blossomed. When my father died, her friends supported
her and she was able to adjust.&nbsp; She enjoyed going to religious services.
The old songs and prayers evoked memories of her childhood. A few months
ago I asked her what she thought about and she said “the old times”; that
is, her childhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>As the middle child in a very strong willed family,
she learned the art of compromise. As the spouse of an Alzheimer’s patient,
she demonstrated patience.&nbsp; As a grandparent and great-grandparent,
her love and affection were evident. As a writer of poetry and short stories,
her intelligence and imagination came into play.&nbsp; And as a friend,
she demonstrated the supportiveness and kindness that were her defining
attributes.&nbsp; Today we commit her body to the ground, but her spirit
and her influence will always be with us.</font></b></td>
