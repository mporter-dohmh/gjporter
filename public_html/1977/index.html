      <p align="left"><big>In</big><big> 1977, I (Jerry) attended a
          meeting in San Jose, California. We took this opportunity to
          camp cross country.&nbsp; In preparation for the trip we
          bought a used pop-up trailer.&nbsp; We pulled this with a
          station wagon.&nbsp; In those days before mandatory sear
          belts, we put a green covered mattress in the back of the
          station wagon and our children (ages 6, 9 and 11) rode back
          there.&nbsp; The camper had small wheels that caused various
          problems on the trip because the tires overheated.&nbsp; In
          Tennessee, a tire lost its tread and we had to detour to
          Little Rock to buy another one.&nbsp; In Sequoia we had a flat
          and I think I must have done a bad job remounting the tire
          because coming down the freeway to San Jose, the wheel came
          off and the camper landed with a thud on the highway.&nbsp; We
          were towed to San Jose.&nbsp; While I was at my meeting the
          camper was repaired and the rest of the family went to San
          Francisco to stay with Judy's Aunt Sarah.&nbsp; But that is a
          story in itself.&nbsp; The trip home was difficult because I
          had become paranoid about the camper and stopped in every
          camper repair facility along the way to check that it was
          okay.&nbsp; On the last day of the trip we started from the
          Indiana Dunes, stopped at the Football Hall of Fame in Canton,
          Ohio and then crossed into Pennsylvania about 6 PM on
          Interstate 80.&nbsp; Any sane person would have stopped for
          the night but by this time I had lost all elements of
          sanity.&nbsp; "We are in Pennsylvania, let's go home!"&nbsp;
          We got home at 3 AM.<br>
        </big></p>
      <p align="left"><big>A map of our trip can be seen by clicking <a
            href="/tripmap.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;
          Google Maps only allows for ten destinations so this is a
          number of Google maps pasted together.&nbsp; It is a pretty
          good approximation to our trip but, of course, leaves out a
          number of side trips.&nbsp; Creating these slide shows from 38
          year old film negatives was an interesting, albeit time
          consuming, experience.&nbsp; The films were for the most part
          scanned by ScanCafe but I realized that some were not scanned
          for various reasons and I had to scan those.&nbsp; All the
          photos need to be edited in some way or another.&nbsp; For
          some, this was just normal processing (e.g., cropping).&nbsp;
          For others the colors had faded and needed to be
          restored.&nbsp; Finally, think about what your reaction would
          be if someone dropped 200 photos in front of you and asked you
          to put them in the order of a trip you took 38 years
          ago.&nbsp; This was a bit easier since I had the original
          negatives and within each roll there was an ordering but still
          I had to try and figure out where the pictures were taken. (No
          GPS information on negatives)&nbsp; Google was a great help
          with there are many photos on the web for most tourist
          sites.&nbsp; (Yosemite and Yellowstone were easy.&nbsp;
          Montezuma Castle and Guadalupe were more difficult.)<br>
        </big></p>
      <p align="left"><big>Over the years, we have traveled to almost
          seventy different countries on six continents.&nbsp; Looking
          at these photos I am once again reminded that there are few
          places in the world that are more scenic than the American
          Southwest and West.&nbsp; Although we have made five or maybe
          more trips to this area, I am always eager to revisit
          it.&nbsp; The Grand Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone are in
          everyone's top ten list but places like Canyon de Chelly&nbsp;
          and the South Dakota Badlands are equally awesome and far less
          crowded.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy these slide shows.<br>
