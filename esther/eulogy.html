<center><b><font size=+2>Eulogy for Esther Revitch by Judith Porter</font></b></center>
<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>My mother was born in 1907 in the shtetl of Zashkov
in the Pale of Settlement in the Ukraine.&nbsp; She was one of four children.
Her father was a shohet and her grandfather a torah scribe, so they were
a family with high religious status.&nbsp; In 1911 they emigrated to the
United States because my grandfather, though ultra orthodox, was concerned
because his daughters could not get a good education in Zashkov.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>They ultimately settled in Strawberry Mansion in North
Philadelphia, where he continued as a shohet with his own chicken killing
business.&nbsp; The Strawberry Mansion in which my mother grew up was an
Eastern European Jewish enclave, with Yiddish the major language and Orthodox
Judaism the religion of choice.&nbsp; The family was poor; my mother did
not have a doll until she was 12 years old.&nbsp; The children helped in
the chicken business. Fairmount Park was their playground and the public
library their destination of choice.&nbsp; My mother was completely bilingual;
Yiddish was the only language spoken in their home. My grandparents, though
they lived til their 80’s, never learned English and though they physically
left Eastern Europe, they took the culture and the dress of the shtetl
with them. They could not help my mother acclimatize to a secular environment,
but her older sister Ida was her mentor in this respect.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>My mother graduated from Girls High in 1925 and from
the University of Pennsylvania in 1929. She helped support herself at Penn
by tutoring rich girls from the Main Line in math. She still remembers
going to their homes to tutor and not knowing what a napkin ring was or
which fork to use.&nbsp; In October of 1929, my grandfather saw lines of
people outside the banks. He thought they were depositing money, and went
home and took all the money he had saved and rushed to the bank and deposited
it. He lost it all since it was the beginning of the great depression and
the banks failed. My mother thought she would have to drop out of college
and help support the family, but Penn gave her a scholarship and encouraged
her to stay in school and she did so and graduated.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>After graduation as a math major, she taught math and
science in East Stroudsberg, PA, the first time she had ever been away
from home, and later returned to Philadelphia as a substitute teacher.&nbsp;
In 1938 she met my father, who had just emigrated from Latvia. He was working
as a delivery boy in his uncle’s pharmacy because no one would accept a
foreign medical school graduate unless he repeated his residency in an
American institution. My mother and he married, and she wrote hundreds
of letters to hospitals all over the east coast asking them to accept him
as a resident in psychiatry. Only one answered, a hospital run by French
nuns in New Brunswick, NJ. Since he spoke fluent French, they gave him
a residency. By then, my mother was pregnant with me and working as a case
worker, walking up and down tenement stairs to help her clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>My father’s family was in Latvia and he suspected what
was happening to them. He enlisted in the US army, and was sent all over
the United States to work in mental hospitals, eventually ending up in
Montana. My mother and I joined him there. She had never been so far away
from home, and it was a difficult adjustment for her since we lived in
an attic and she was totally unfamiliar with military culture.&nbsp; However,
she learned to adjust but was happy when the war ended and we returned
to Philadelphia. My father began work in a VA hospital in New Jersey, and
we eventually moved to a small apartment in Plainfield. My father began
his own practice, and for 48 years my mother became his business manager.
She and my father had a wonderful marriage and a real division of labor.
He treated his patients and decided the great political and social issues
of the day. She cooked, cleaned, did his typing, paid the bills, and was
his secretary and receptionist. She was the solid ground that allowed him
to pursue his career without being bothered by the trivia of daily life.&nbsp;
She was very proud of and identified with his accomplishments, always minimizing
her own considerable intelligence and capability but without her, he could
not have been as successful as he was. They were happily married for 58
years until he died in 1996. They moved to Martin’s Run in 1990 and made
many good friends and were very happy here.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;My mother highly valued intellectual development.
Even when she moved permanently to the nursing home and could no longer
see well, she looked forward to daily visits from her good friend Elsie
who read her the newspaper headlines and discussed what was happening n
the world with her. At a time when women were not encouraged to pursue
PhD’s, she was my cheering squad and never doubted that I would do it.
She liked to write poetry and short stories and when she was younger, played
the piano well.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;She was not a joiner of organizations. Her strongest
value and her greatest joy was her family.&nbsp; She was a wonderful daughter
and sister, taking care of her parents in old age and was the peacemaker
in a strong-willed group of siblings.&nbsp; She was always there for all
of them. She was utterly devoted to my father. When he developed Alzheimer’s
and lost his vision, she was his eyes and ears and she took care of him
until the end.&nbsp; She was also a devoted mother, even putting up with
my musical tastes during my adolescence although they were far from hers.
She even grew to appreciate Elvis Presley and early rock and roll (or at
least she said she did).&nbsp;</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>She was also a fantastic grandmother. Her grandchildren
were the joy of her life. When they could not stand us any more, they always
went for support and affirmation to their grandmother, who put up with
adolescent behavior with humor, gave them love and support, and never criticized
them or said no.&nbsp; They returned her affection. Whenever we visited
her, even if we had seen her the previous day, she always started conversations
with “so what have you heard from the children?” She delighted in her four
great-grandchildren. When we saw her the day before she died, we told her
what they were doing, their accomplishments, and the cute things they said
and for the first time in several weeks, we saw her smile.</font></b><b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;She lived a long and happy life.&nbsp; We knew
that at 96 years of age she would not live forever and that one day she
would depart this earth, we hoped in a peaceful sleep. It is a real tragedy
for her and for us that she died due to injuries sustained from a fire
caused by the heater in her room in the Care Center and that she suffered
so for seven weeks.&nbsp; The Chester Crozer Regional Burn Center made
heroic efforts to keep her alive, but her body could not withstand the
trauma of smoke-damaged lungs.&nbsp; We will always remember her kindness,
her caring, her intelligence, and yes, her feistiness. Zikhrona Livrakha.
May her memory be a blessing.</font></b></td>
